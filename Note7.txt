Type inference vs Type annotation

-   Type inference: TS will guess datatype of a variable by using a specific algorithm
    + use when you are not sure about containing value of a variable
-   Type annotation: Dev specifically declare datatype of a variable
    + use when you want to ensure during life cycle of that variable it just can be assign by the original datatype
